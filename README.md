# Flex-box Cheat Sheet

### Introduction

Welcome to my **flex-box** project. This web page is a demonstration of my flex-box knowledge and experience, and it documents flex-box's
properties alongside worked examples. These include, but are *not* limited to:
- Display
- Flex-direction
- Flex-wrap

I have split these into two categories, being **parent properties** and **child properties**, as shown below:

| parent elements | child elements |
| --------- | --------- |
| display | order |
| flex-direction | flex-grow |
| flex-wrap | flex-shrink |
| flex-flow | flex-basis |
| Justify-content | flex |
| align-items | align-self |
| align-content |  |
| gap |  |

### Versions

#### Version 1
The initial version of this document has the main function of displaying my knowledge and as such I will not be focusing on how users would
perceive the information displayed. The main targets are:
1. Using flex-box, create examples for every property and include an explanation of what is happening.
2. Create a **scenarios** page which has some real-world problems, and then a solution using flex-box

#### Version 2
This version will focus on usability and helping others to understand flexbox. Since the descriptions/explanations so far are quite difficult
for other users to follow/gain understanding from, I will reword these and use formatting to emphasise key points. The main targets will be:
1. Translate current narrative to be user-friendly
2. Format webpage so that emphasis is drawn to the correct places

#### Version 3
The third (and final) version will be a challenge to myself to add some additional features to the webpage to make it more interactive, and
to show off my skills. The main targets will be:
1. Add drop down features to the nav bar so that users can navigate straight to a specific flex-box property header rather than having to
scroll
2. Give the nav bar a gradient to increase visual appeal
3. Use JavaScript to create a 'see solution' button on the real-world scenarios page, which reveals the flex-box solutions to the problem
listed
